# Hi there!

<p><small>I'm Ryan, a senior in high school. Thanks for visiting this corner of the internet!</small></p>

<p><small>I love learning new things and building projects. I'm currently a researcher in the Henkelman Research Group at UT Austin where I work on machine learning applications for computational physics, specifically molecular simulation.</small></p>

## What is it that you do, exactly?

<p><small>I'm deeply interested in the intersection of computer science and the natural sciences. Computers are great at crunching numbers, while humans excel at recognizing and exploiting patterns. This intersection naturally leads to the field of computational science.</small></p>

<p><small>Computers can process massive datasets incredibly quickly to make predictions, revolutionizing modern life. With the rapid advancement of machine learning technologies, computers can now analyze data to find patterns that humans might miss and even discover new phenomena. This has reignited interest in fields of science that seemed to be stagnating.</small></p>

<p><small>For example, the discovery of the Halicin antibiotic was made possible through machine learning, as detailed in <a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(20)30102-1?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS0092867420301021%3Fshowall%3Dtrue">this study</a>.</small></p>

<p><small>In addition, computational science often involves simulating systems of interest. I'm fascinated by how we can create custom microcosms in a computer using a set of physical principles to generate accurate predictions about the real world. It's like having an entire universe within your control to explore and experiment with.</small></p>

<p><small>I'm particularly interested in simulating biochemical systems (such as protein structure and function, metabolism, and drug development) and inorganic chemical systems (like batteries and inorganic catalysts).</small></p>

## Fun stuff!

<p><small>Astrophotography is one of my many hobbies. I enjoy taking photos of Deep Sky Objects (DSOs), feel free to browse my portfolio of photos <a href="/gallery">here!</a></small></p>

<p><small>I also really enjoy writing computer simulations and building projects with my hands, especially those that have visuals. You can browse a portfolio of projects that I have completed or am currently working on <a href="/projects">here!</a></small></p>

# Meta

## Site details!

<p><small>The fluid simulation on the homepage is actually ripped off the example from the Fluid-JS project. You can find information about it <a href="https://github.com/malik-tillman/Fluid-JS">here</a>. If you didn't notice the simulation, try clicking and dragging around. You need to be on desktop for this to work, I don't think it works on mobile. It's pretty cool!</small></p>
